Logistic regression in Python using JupyterLab : 
'Logistic regression analysis studies the association between 
a categorical dependent variable Y and a set of independent (explanatory)
variables. 
The name logistic regression is used when the dependent 
variable has only two values, such as 0 and 1 or Yes and No. 
The name multinomial logistic regression is usually reserved for the
case when the dependent variable has three or more unique values, such 
as Married, Single, Divored, or Widowed. Although the type of data used 
for the dependent variable is different from that of multiple regression,
the practical use of the procedure is similar.' Source : NCSS Statistical Software.
